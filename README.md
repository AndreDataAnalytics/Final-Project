# # Talent Optimization Project

In the post-pandemic era, significant shifts in human resource management, talent retention, and acquisition have become apparent across various industries. While not universal, sectors such as technology are particularly affected, grappling with a growing scarcity of talent. Consequently, companies are urged to invest more in talent retention processes.

This project recognizes the importance of prioritizing employee well-being as a key strategy for talent retention. Improving well-being correlates with increased productivity. In the current challenging macroeconomic landscape, influenced notably by rising interest rates, companies must redirect their focus to their most valuable asset â€“ human capital.

## Project Overview

The project operates on the premise that each individual possesses unique characteristics that can and should be optimized. Teams with diverse profiles are more balanced and offer greater value to the company, subsequently enhancing individual and overall productivity.

Using the Big Five personality traits test, a quick 8-minute assessment comprising 50 questions rated on a scale of 1 to 5 (where 1 indicates complete disagreement and 5 indicates complete agreement), the project aims to identify prevalent personality traits in each employee. The objective is not to classify individuals or compare them to peers but to provide insight into the composition of the company's human resources regarding dominant personality profiles.

## Implementation

The project utilizes machine learning clustering methodologies adaptable to various organizational sizes. The tests are based on 1,013,558 responses to the questionnaire.
